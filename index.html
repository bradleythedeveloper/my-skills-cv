            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Bradley. I am a Year 12 student in St Peter's Sixth Form, studying Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science.</p>
            <p>I am a determined and resilient person who strives to be the best version of myself that I can be, while also helping others to achieve the same goal. 
                I strive to be helpful and considerate, so that people can always depend on me for help, motivation and advice. I also take kindness and politeness very seriously. 
                I am a very careful and cautious person who meticulously tries to observe the bigger picture of every situation before making decisions. 
                I am a very quiet and reserved person most of the time, so I am often able to work well by myself â€“ however, I can also be a very outgoing person in certain situations, who is passionate about what I talk about, and who can collaborate in a group with others to achieve a greater goal.</p>
